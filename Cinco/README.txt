*Extra Credit* Quick-Guess Addition:

Workings: this program add on works by adding ANY single word or
or character as a command line argument (i.e. goQuick, balloon, p, etc.).
This command line argument initiates the "quick-guess" mode which deletes
all words with duplicate characters before the game begins. 

Results:

**Interestingly, the "quick-guess" mode seemed to do quite the opposite!
With the standard game mode guessing, on average, in 6.55% less guesses...
